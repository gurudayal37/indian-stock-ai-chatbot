Subject: PEAD Trading Strategy Project - Significant Progress Update & Technical Questions

Dear [Mentor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to provide a comprehensive update on my Automated Earnings-Based Trading Strategy for NIFTY 500 Companies project and seek your guidance on several technical decisions.

PROJECT PROGRESS SUMMARY

COMPLETED MILESTONES:

1. Data Infrastructure & Collection:
   - Successfully scraped quarterly financial data for all NIFTY 500 companies from BSE
   - Created comprehensive database schema for storing quarterly results, stock metadata, and historical data
   - Implemented robust data collection pipeline with error handling and retry mechanisms

2. Database & Backend Development:
   - Built PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon (cloud-based)
   - Developed FastAPI backend with RESTful APIs for data access
   - Implemented data validation and transformation pipelines
   - Created automated data synchronization scripts

3. Frontend & Visualization:
   - Built responsive web dashboard using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
   - Implemented interactive charts for quarterly results visualization
   - Created stock detail pages with comprehensive financial metrics
   - Deployed live application on Render.com (https://stock-analyzer-l9hy.onrender.com)

4. Data Quality & Validation:
   - Implemented dual data sources (BSE + Screener.in) for data validation
   - Created data consistency checks and transformation logic
   - Established automated data quality monitoring

CURRENT DATA STATUS:
- Total Companies: 500+ NIFTY 500 stocks
- Data Coverage: Quarterly results for multiple quarters
- Data Sources: BSE (official) + Screener.in (validation)
- Database: Fully operational with real-time access

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS REQUIRING YOUR GUIDANCE:

1. Analyst EPS Expectations Data Source
Challenge: I need reliable analyst EPS expectations data to implement the core PEAD strategy.
Options I'm considering:
- Financial data APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg API)
- Broker research reports (automated scraping)
- Consensus estimates from financial websites
Question: What would you recommend as the most reliable and cost-effective source for analyst expectations?

2. Standalone vs Consolidated Financials
Current Situation: I'm collecting both standalone and consolidated quarterly results, but need to decide which to use for the trading strategy.
Considerations:
- Standalone: Company's core operations only
- Consolidated: Includes subsidiaries and joint ventures
Question: For PEAD strategy, should I focus on standalone or consolidated EPS? What's the industry standard for earnings-based trading strategies?

3. Data Source Discrepancies
Issue: I've noticed significant differences between BSE raw data and Screener.in processed data for the same companies.
Examples:
- Revenue figures can differ by 5-10%
- EPS calculations show variations
Question: How should I handle these discrepancies? Should I use BSE as primary (official) source, or implement a validation mechanism?

4. Latest Quarterly Results Detection
Challenge: Automatically identifying when new quarterly results are published.
Current Approach: Scheduled scraping every few hours
Question: What's the most efficient way to detect new earnings announcements? Should I monitor NSE/BSE announcements or rely on data availability?

5. PEAD Strategy Implementation
Next Phase: Moving from data collection to strategy implementation.
Questions:
- What's the optimal holding period for PEAD trades (1-2 weeks as planned)?
- Should I implement position sizing based on earnings surprise magnitude?
- How to handle earnings announcements during market hours vs after hours?

NEXT STEPS PLANNED:

1. Analyst Expectations Integration (pending your guidance on data source)
2. PEAD Signal Generation (buy/sell logic implementation)
3. Backtesting Framework (historical strategy performance analysis)
4. Risk Management Module (position sizing, stop-losses)
5. Paper Trading Implementation (before live trading)

- Phase 5 (Paper Trading): Planned for final phase

I would greatly appreciate your insights on the technical questions above, particularly regarding analyst expectations data sources and the standalone vs consolidated decision. These choices will significantly impact the strategy's effectiveness.

Thank you for your continued guidance and support. I look forward to your feedback and suggestions.

Best regards,
